### Introduction

Rapid innovations in the design and development of online learning platforms such as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), and Learning Management System (LMS) not only have overcome the limitations of space and time but have also made access to education easy and affordable. Evaluating and analyzing the students’ data generated from online learning platforms can help instructors to understand and monitor students learning progress. The earlier the students’ performance is detected in the VLEs, the better it is for the instructor to persuade and warn students for keeping them on the right track. Earlier studies report that the students learning variables stored in the database records can help instructors in predicting the performance of students in the future. But predicting students’ performance earlier in the course would be more helpful as compared to predicting students’ performance once they have completed the course and have given the final exam. However, developing a predictive model that can identify the exact learning behavior of students earlier in the course by analyzing their behavior data is a challenging task. In an online learning environment, where a large amount of data is generated every day, machine learning (ML) techniques could help in analyzing the variables that define the students and come up with the results that better describe their learning behavior, thus, ML may reveal information that is beneficial for both instructors and students.
